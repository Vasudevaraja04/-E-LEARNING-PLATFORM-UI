THIS IS A SIMPLE E-LEARNING PLATFORM BUILT USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT. IT ALLOWS USERS TO VIEW A LIST OF COURSES, TRACK THEIR PROGRESS, AND WATCH EMBEDDED VIDEO LESSONS. THE WEBSITE IS DESIGNED TO BE USER-FRIENDLY, COLORFUL, AND ATTRACTIVE, MAKING LEARNING ENGAGING AND INTERACTIVE.

### WORKING OF THE WEBSITE
**1. NAVIGATION BAR**
AT THE TOP OF THE WEBSITE, THERE IS A NAVIGATION BAR WITH THE TITLE "E-LEARNING PLATFORM".
THIS HEADER STAYS FIXED AND MAKES THE WEBSITE LOOK ORGANIZED.

**2. COURSE LISTING**
BELOW THE NAVIGATION BAR, THERE IS A SECTION THAT DISPLAYS A LIST OF AVAILABLE COURSES.
EACH COURSE IS PLACED INSIDE A COURSE CARD, WHICH HAS THE FOLLOWING:
COURSE NAME (E.G., "REACT BASICS", "VUE.JS FUNDAMENTALS", "NODE.JS ESSENTIALS")
PROGRESS BAR TO SHOW HOW MUCH OF THE COURSE IS COMPLETED
A VIEW COURSE BUTTON TO WATCH THE VIDEO

**3. PROGRESS TRACKING**
EACH COURSE HAS A PROGRESS BAR THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH OF THE COURSE IS COMPLETED.
DIFFERENT COURSES HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRESS LEVELS (E.G., 60% FOR REACT, 30% FOR VUE, 80% FOR NODE.JS).
THE PROGRESS BAR CHANGES COLOR BASED ON THE COURSE:
REACT – BLUE
VUE – GREEN
ODE – DARK GREEN

4. VIDEO EMBEDDING FUNCTIONALITY
WHEN A USER CLICKS ON THE "VIEW COURSE" BUTTON, A VIDEO PLAYER APPEARS.
THE YOUTUBE VIDEO FOR THAT COURSE IS LOADED INTO AN IFRAME.
USERS CAN WATCH THE COURSE VIDEO DIRECTLY FROM THE WEBSITE.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
**1. HTML (STRUCTURE)**
HTML IS USED TO CREATE THE STRUCTURE OF THE WEBSITE.
ELEMENTS LIKE HEADERS, SECTIONS, BUTTONS, AND PROGRESS BARS ARE ALL MADE WITH HTML.

**2. CSS (STYLING & DESIGN)**
CSS MAKES THE WEBSITE LOOK ATTRACTIVE AND COLORFUL.
IT ADDS STYLES, COLORS, BUTTON HOVER EFFECTS, AND SHADOWS TO MAKE THE WEBSITE MORE VISUALLY APPEALING.
THE PROGRESS BARS HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS TO MAKE THEM STAND OUT.
THE COURSE CARDS HAVE A HOVER EFFECT, MAKING THEM INTERACTIVE.

**3. JAVASCRIPT (FUNCTIONALITY & INTERACTIVITY)**
JAVASCRIPT IS USED TO MAKE THE WEBSITE INTERACTIVE.
WHEN A USER CLICKS ON A COURSE, JAVASCRIPT:
DISPLAYS THE VIDEO PLAYER
LOADS THE SELECTED COURSE VIDEO INTO THE PLAYER
THIS MAKES THE WEBSITE DYNAMIC AND ENGAGING.
